# Welcome, Fellow Artisans

My name is Ed. I'm a web developer with 20 years of experience, mostly in Perl and PHP. These days I spend most of my
time inside the Laravel ecosystem. This site serves as my playground and my classroom where I experiment, break things,
and share what I discover.

### About This Site

I'm currently running [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com) on [Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com). For no good reason, of
course. This is a simple site right now with no database. Just a cache and some files sitting on GitHub. Anyway, feel
free to read my vapor.yml file to see my setup. I make extensive use of TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, and Livewire as well as
packages from Spatie and Ryan Chandler.

The sidebar at the right works like it would in your editor. It pulls the files from GitHub, caches them, and displays
them here. Markdown files can be toggled between the rendered HTML and the markdown. The sidebar can be hidden with the
same key combination that you'd use to hide it in PHPStorm.

My goal is to just keep pushing this experiment as far as I can. Use it to learn, teach, and have fun. I hope you enjoy
it and hit me up if you have any ideas or feedback.

### Want To Get In Touch?

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaybeEdward) and [GitHub](https://github.com/edgrosvenor). You can email me at
<ed@gros.co>. And once in a while, you can find me at the bar during a PHP conference in the US or Europe.
