# Stuff I Have Bookmarked

### Design Resources

I am not a designer. I struggle with HTML and CSS. I hate javascript with a hot, flaming passion. I live on the 
server side, but not everything I touch comes with a front end budget. So here are a list of the resources that let 
me get my work done without getting bogged down in a struggle I can't win.

[Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/): This might just be the best money I've ever spent. These well written, well 
documented components make it really easy to throw together the front end of your MVP in a weekend.

[Tenscope's Free Logos](https://www.tenscope.co/free-logos): Tenscope is a design firm that sells thier services 
on a subscription basis. They offer a small collection of free, royalty-free logos that work well if you just need 
something quick and clean to go along with that new domain you registered.
