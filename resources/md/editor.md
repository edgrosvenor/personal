### My PHPStorm Setup

I am definitely not a PHPStorm power user. I'm getting better, thanks in large part to
[Mastering PHPStorm](https://masteringphpstorm.com/) by [Christoph Rumpel](https://twitter.com/christophrumpel). I use
the light version of the theme that Christoph included in the course.

The first thing you absolutely must do as a Laravel developer is to install the
[Laravel IDE Helper Generator](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) package in all your Laravel apps. It's
free and really easy to set up. Once you run it, PHPStorm will be able to see behind the magic curtain and provide
autocomplete for things like model methods. This is great for people like me who can't remember whether it's
`updateOrCreate` or `createOrUpdate`.

If you can afford it or are eligible for a free license, [Laravel IDEA](https://laravel-idea.com) fills in the rest of
the gaps in your IDE's knowledge of the framework. Between this and teh IDE Helper Generator, it's a very rare day when
I leave a <span data-tooltip="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line:
underline; text-decoration-style: wavy; text-decoration-color:#ddd;">squiggly line</span> under a single line of code.

As for aesthetics, I keep all the windows except the main editor hidden. I do frequently use the project files 
sidebar (as shown to the right), but keep it closed most of the time and open it up with ⌘1 when I need it. Fun side 
note... ⌘1 will toggle the navigation sidebar on the right of this site.
